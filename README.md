# Pterattack
 
 A simple [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game based off Neopets' [Pterattack](https://www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=587) using assets/knowledge from (Heartbeast)[https://www.youtube.com/c/uheartbeast] on Youtube and his [course](https://www.heartgamedev.com/1-bit-godot-course-youtube). 
 
 Refresher after not using Godot in a while. 
 Has some actions, but waiting on assets to animate them. Will probably upload to itch.io when complete.
 
 ## Gameplay
 
Your goal is to reach the "end", and that is indicated by the distance bar on the far right. There's an energy bar at the top that is constantly depleting even if you do not move. Enemies constantly spawn as you travel. Each action takes a set amount of energy, and running into enemies takes a chunk. When killing enemies, energy will be dropped. Sometimes a powerup will drop.

The idea is that you can choose your own playstyle rather than just have a shoot-em-up and get a high-score kind of thing.
